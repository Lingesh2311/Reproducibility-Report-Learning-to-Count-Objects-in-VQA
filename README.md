This reproduces the results of the toytask dataset due to computational constraints on the dataset. Although done on a small scale using the available computation at the time of reproduction. This code generates the results with great accuracy. Experiments using 8+1 and 32+1 weights
for the linear activation functions was done as mentioned but not implemented in the original paper.
